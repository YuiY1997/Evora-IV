You have and your family have lived for generations on the icy planetoid of Evora IV, a place far beyond the boundaries of the Segmentum Pacificus and Lannah sector within. It is closer to the untamable and unknowable Halo zone than the rest of human space. 
The a detachment of Adeptus Sororitas Order of Our Martyred Lady were brought to the world after recieving visions relating to a martyred saint from the Belrath Crusade. Years later, the mechanicus came as well to extract the valuable minerals from the permafrost of the planetoid. For a time the city was prosperous, but that was before the warp storms.

Eighty years ago, the people of Aquileia, an otherwise unremarkable city on the border of the tamed lands of Evora IV witnessed the greatest of miracles. In unison, hundreds heard the voice of the God Emperor of Man. Dozens died simply from exposure to the psychic force. The entity spoke but one word, "Prepare". The apparition has since been dubbed "Our Lord of Aquileia". The warp storms came the same day cutting off the planet from the rest of the galaxy.
Now with the planet cut off for generations, the political situation has become more tense as many groups turn to squabbling on the snowblasted rock, surrounded on all sides by the unknown.
